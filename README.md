# AI-Go-Player_game

###  description: 
an artificial Go player, that can play games against a human opponent. Go is an abstract strategy board 
game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented 
in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the 
present day. The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The 
players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections ("points") of a board. Once placed on the board, 
stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if "captured". Capture happens when a stone 
or group of stones is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally-adjacent points. The game proceeds 
until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by 
counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of 
the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid 
of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards

### system details: 
  #### human versus agents
  we implemented Two types of agents
  The first agent is the strongest. It was implemented using minimax alpha-beta search algorithms
  The second agent is less powerful than the first. It was implemented using heuristic search algorithms by random number.

This game was implemented with the contribution of my friend named Mohamed A.Shaker
